# Birthday Card

I created this simple, one page, non-interactive app to make a birthday card for my friend. 

**This was used to practice the following Android development concepts:**
- Composables
- Preview
- Modifiers
- Adding images using resouce manager
- Using stringResource() to remove hardcoded strings
